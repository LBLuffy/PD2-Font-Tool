# Diesel-Font-Tool

The Diesel Font Tool allows you to create fonts for the three main Diesel games: PDTH, PD2 and Raid WW2.

This is the source code of the tool. The tool by itself is fairly simple and mostly uses the Diesel Engine Formats DLL found in here -> https://github.com/Luffyyy/DieselEngineFormats

You can download a public version here: https://modworkshop.net/mydownloads.php?action=view_down&did=15221#description or in releases tab.
